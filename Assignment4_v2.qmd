## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#load data
library(tidyverse)
hate_crimes <- read_csv(file = "/Users/alekhya/Desktop/03_ARC School/02 McCourt Year 2/Data Science/Assignment04/data/hate_crimes.csv")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#graph of relationship between Trump voters and hate crimes
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = hate_crimes) + 
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = share_voters_voted_trump, y = hate_crimes_per_100k_splc, color = "red", size = 5))
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
