## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#load data
library(tidyverse)
hate_crimes <- read_csv(file = "/Users/alekhya/Desktop/03_ARC School/02 McCourt Year 2/Data Science/Assignment04/data/hate_crimes.csv")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#First Graph: relationship between Trump voters and hate crimes
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

hate_crimes %>% 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = share_voters_voted_trump, y = hate_crimes_per_100k_splc)) + 
  geom_jitter() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(y = "Hate Crimes per 100k Population", x = "Share of Voters who Voted Trump", title = "Hate Crimes are Common in Polarized States", subtitle = "Association between Hate Crimes and Trump Voters", caption ="Majumder, M. 2017. 'Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality'. FiveThirtyEight.") + 
  theme_economist_white() + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)


  

 
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

hate_crimes <- read_csv("/Users/Juj/Desktop/hate_crimes.csv") 
  
hate_crimes %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x= share_non_white, y = gini_index)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  theme_light() +
  labs(
    y = "State's Gini Index",
    x = "State's Share of Non-White Population",
    caption ="Majumder, M. 2017. 'Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality'. FiveThirtyEight.",
    title = "Whiter States Tend to Have Lower Levels of Income Inequality")+ 
  theme(
        axis.text=element_text(size=8, color = "blue",
                               hjust = 0.5), 
        plot.title=element_text(size=10, face = "bold"),
        axis.title=element_text(size=9),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 6, face = "italic")
      )

```

Narrative Interpretations:

"Hate Crimes Are Common in Polarized States": This graph shows the relationship between the proportion of Trump voters in a given state and the number of hate crimes per 100K people committed in that state. We might hypothesize that there would be a higher rate of hate crimes in states dominated by Trump voters, but in fact this graph illustrates that hate crimes are more prevalent in states where 40%-50% of voters support Trump. In other words, hate crimes are more prevalent in states that have a greater degree of political polarization, compared to states with a higher percentage of Trump voters. We also see an outlier in the District of Columbia, which has a very low percent of Trump voters (4%) but a high rate of hate crimes (1.5 per 100K). This is likely due to the fact that DC has a much smaller population size than most states, but a relatively high number of hate crimes compared to other small states.
