## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#load data
library(tidyverse)
#alekhya
hate_crimes <- read_csv(file = "/Users/alekhya/Desktop/03_ARC School/02 McCourt Year 2/Data Science/Assignment04/data/hate_crimes.csv")

#juliet
#hate_crimes <- read_csv(file = "C:/Users/kjcst/Downloads/hate_crimes.csv")

#kieran
#hate_crimes <- read_csv("/Users/Juj/Desktop/hate_crimes.csv") 
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#Graph of relationship between Trump voters and hate crimes
library(ggplot2)

hate_crimes_diverse <- hate_crimes %>%
  mutate(diverse = if_else(share_non_white>0.4, 1, 0))

hate_crimes_diverse %>%

  geom_jitter() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(y = "Hate Crimes per 100k Population", x = "Share of Voters who Voted Trump", title = "Hate Crimes are Less Common in Areas with High Proportions of Trump Voters", subtitle = "Polarized Areas See Higher Rates of Hate Crimes", caption ="Majumder, M. 2017. 'Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality'. FiveThirtyEight.") +
    theme(
        axis.text = element_text(size=8, color = "blue",
                               hjust = 0.5), 
        plot.title = element_text(size=10, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8, hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(size=9),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 6, face = "italic")
      ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```

"Hate Crimes Are Common in Polarized States": This graph shows the relationship between the proportion of Trump voters in a given state and the number of hate crimes per 100K people committed in that state. We might hypothesize that there would be a higher rate of hate crimes in states dominated by Trump voters, but in fact this graph illustrates that hate crimes are more prevalent in states where 40%-50% of voters support Trump. In other words, hate crimes are more prevalent in states that have a greater degree of political polarization, compared to states with a higher percentage of Trump voters. We also see an outlier in the District of Columbia, which has a very low percent of Trump voters (4%) but a high rate of hate crimes (1.5 per 100K). This is likely due to the fact that DC has a much smaller population size than most states, but a relatively high number of hate crimes compared to other small states.

"Racialized Income Inequality in the States": This graph demonstrates the positive correlation between the share of people of color in a state's population and income inequality as measured by the gini coefficient. The racial wealth gap in the country, which is caused by the legacy of slavery as well as historical and ongoing discrimination in employment, housing, and education, is driving the dynamic that we see in this graph. Because this dataset was created to think through questions of income inequality, we thought it was important to include a graph that would capture the fact that income inequality is a racialized phenomenon in this country, which the initial authors did not explore in their analysis.

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
