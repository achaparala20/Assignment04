## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#load data
library(tidyverse)
hate_crimes <- read_csv(file = "/Users/alekhya/Desktop/03_ARC School/02 McCourt Year 2/Data Science/Assignment04/data/hate_crimes.csv")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#graph of relationship between Trump voters and hate crimes
library(ggplot2)

hate_crimes %>% 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = share_voters_voted_trump, y = hate_crimes_per_100k_splc)) + 
  geom_jitter() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(y = "Hate Crimes per 100k Population", x = "Share of Voters who Voted Trump", title = "Hate Crimes are Less Common in Areas with High Proportions of Trump Voters", subtitle = "Polarized Areas See Higher Rates of Hate Crimes", caption ="Majumder, M. 2017. 'Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality'. FiveThirtyEight.") 
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

#hate_crimes <- read_csv("/Users/Juj/Desktop/hate_crimes.csv") 
  
hate_crimes %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x= share_non_white, y = gini_index)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(
    y = "State's Gini Index",
    x = "State's Share of Non-White Population",
    caption ="Majumder, M. 2017. 'Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality'. FiveThirtyEight.",
    title = "Racialized Income Inequality in the States",
    subtitle = "The Whitest States Tend to Have The Lowest Inequality Levels")+ 
  theme(
        axis.text = element_text(size=8, color = "blue",
                               hjust = 0.5), 
        plot.title = element_text(size=10, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8, hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(size=9),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 6, face = "italic")
      )

```

```{r}
hate_crimes %>%
  na.omit(hate_crimes_per_100k_splc) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= state,y= avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi))+
  geom_point(color="purple", size=.5, alpha=1) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=state, xend=state, y=0, yend=avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0,0)), limits = c(0, 12)) +
  theme_classic() +
  coord_flip() +
    labs(x = NULL, 
         y = "Average Hate Crimes per 100,000",
         title = "Hate Crimes in Each State",
         subtitle = "According to FBI Crime Statistics, 2010-2015",
         caption ="Majumder, M. 2017. 'Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality'. FiveThirtyEight.",
         ) +
  theme(
        axis.text=element_text (size=4),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 6, face = "italic"),
        axis.line.y = element_line(color = "transparent"),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        plot.title=element_text(size=10, face = "bold", hjust = .5),
        plot.subtitle= element_text(size = 8,hjust = .5),
        axis.title=element_text(size=7),
        
      ) 

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
