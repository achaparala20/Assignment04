## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#load data
library(tidyverse)
hate_crimes <- read_csv(file = "https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/hate-crimes/hate_crimes.csv")

#hate_crimes <- read_csv(file = "/Users/alekhya/Desktop/03_ARC School/02 McCourt Year 2/Data Science/Assignment04/data/hate_crimes.csv")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#graph of relationship between Trump voters and hate crimes
library(ggplot2)


```

```{r}

```

```{+}
  geom_jitter() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(y = "Hate Crimes per 100k Population", x = "Share of Voters who Voted Trump", title = "Hate Crimes are Less Common in Areas with High Proportions of Trump Voters", subtitle = "Polarized Areas See Higher Rates of Hate Crimes", caption ="Majumder, M. 2017. 'Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality'. FiveThirtyEight.") 


  

 
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

hate_crimes <- read_csv("https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/hate-crimes/hate_crimes.csv") 
  
hate_crimes %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x= share_non_white, y = gini_index)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  theme_light() +
  labs(
    y = "State's Gini Index",
    x = "State's Share of Non-White Population",
    caption ="Majumder, M. 2017. 'Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality'. FiveThirtyEight.",
    title = "Whiter States Tend to Have Lower Levels of Income Inequality")+ 
  theme(
        axis.text=element_text(size=8, color = "blue",
                               hjust = 0.5), 
        plot.title=element_text(size=10, face = "bold"),
        axis.title=element_text(size=9),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 6, face = "italic")
      )

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

hate_crimes <- read_csv(file = "C:/Users/kjcst/Downloads/hate_crimes.csv") 

hate_crimes %>% 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .5, fill = "darkgreen", color = "gray") + 
  labs(
    y = "Count of States",
    x = "Average Hate Crimes Per 100k",
    caption ="Majumder, M. 2017. 'Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality'. FiveThirtyEight.",
    title = "Most States Have Hate Crimes Rates of .5 to 3 per 100k"
    )



```
